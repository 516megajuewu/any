# cto.new Python Hello World

This repository contains a minimal Python example used to validate the development workflow on cto.new.
It demonstrates how to initialize a repository, add source code, and run it locally.

## Running the example
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed (`python3 --version`).
2. Run the script with `python3 src/hello_world.py`.
3. You should see the output `Hello, cto.new!` in your terminal.

## Next steps
Future iterations can expand this project with tests, packaging, or more complex application logic.
